Analysing Climate Change related misinformation discourse from May 2019 - July 2022 on Twitter using Natural Language Processing in Python

Abstract:

Twitter has proven instrumental in the spread of misinformation, with fake news posts propagating faster on the platform than factual posts, with no policies within Twitter for flagging or removing misinformation or disinformation, Twitter will only remove posts if it breaks their policies. This report aims to analyse social media data from Twitter gathered from May 2019 to July 2022, tweets were only collected if they contained predefined misinformation terms. Out of the original misinformation tweets, I filtered them by climate change related terms which were ”climate”, ”climate change” and ”warming”. The first objective was to investigate the trends of climate change related tweets in the last 4 years and to monitor how world events have affected it. The results clearly displayed a drop in climate change related tweets in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and a continuous upwards trend from 2021 to the present day. The second objective was to use Natural Language Processing models from Python on the tweets to derive insight from the tweets and represent a story of themes from each month. Exploratory data analysis, pre-processing text and NLP methods such as Ngrams, WordClouds, Hashtag co-occurrence, Top hashtags, Concordance and TF-IDF were used.

This project was conducted over 10 weeks for my MSc Computing and IT Management dissertation and final project.
